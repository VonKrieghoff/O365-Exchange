## To output in console:
#Get-EXOMailbox -ResultSize 1000 | select-object @{n='Identity';e={$_.UserPrincipalName}} | Get-MailboxPermission | Where-Object { -not ($_.User -like "NT AUTHORITY\SELF") } | format-table -AutoSize

## To Output in Excel:
Get-EXOMailbox -ResultSize Unlimited | select-object @{n='Identity';e={$_.UserPrincipalName}} | Get-MailboxPermission | Where-Object { -not ($_.User -like "NT AUTHORITY\SELF") } | Export-Excel $ExcelFile -AutoSize -StartRow 2 -TableName Report
# Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited - gets all mailboxes in o365 tenant, you can also replace unlimited with 1000 for example so only 1000 mailboxes will be red.
# select-object @{n='Identity';e={$_.UserPrincipalName}} - Maps UserPrincipalName as Identity, this is needed because if you have duplicated user Full names in directory the error will happen and results will not look clean.
# Get-MailboxPermission | Where-Object { -not ($_.User -like "NT AUTHORITY\SELF") } - gets mailbox permissions except where user have permissions for its own mailbox, there is no point of that information, of course user will have access to its own mailbox.
# format-table -AutoSize - formats output table with dynamic column width
